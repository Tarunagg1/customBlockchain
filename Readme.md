## Properties of a block

Earlier, we mentioned that the blockchain is composed of several blocks. Let’s explore what the properties of each block are. Every block in the chain is made up of the following properties:<br>

Proof of work: The amount of computational effort required to get a block hash <br>
Block hash: Block ID derived through cryptographic calculation<br>
Timestamp: Time when the block was created<br>
Index: Block’s position on the chain<br>
Data recorded on the blockchain
The previous block’s hash<br>
